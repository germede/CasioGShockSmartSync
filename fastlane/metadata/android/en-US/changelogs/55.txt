- Add the ability to auto-sync the watch's time periodically initiated from the watch (4 times per day)
- In addition to time update, the calendar events are are also updated periodically.
- Added ability to enable/disable auto-time sync in Settings.
- Fixed an issue with actions. If the action button was pressed a second time to run actions again, the second attempt failed. Now this is working.
